### Introduction

Go 1.10 is the first major release after the announcement of the plans
[towards Go 2.0](https://blog.golang.org/toward-go2) at
[GopherCon 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Zbh_vmAKvk).

There are a number of exciting changes which I'll cover below as well as some
changes in the behavior of either tools or Go APIs which might result in
an unexpected behavior compared to the previous change. I chose to flag these
changes as "breaking change" in order to make it easier to identify them.

I've also tried to flag the CL that brought in the change as the discussions on
them as well as the related changes in other CLs are a great source from
learning how Go is organized, created, how features are reviewed, and hopefully
inspire you to [contribute](https://golang.org/doc/contribute.html) to the
language itself by either participating in reviews or issues or fixing
issues (like
[Needs Investigation](https://github.com/golang/go/labels/NeedsInvestigation) or
[Help Wanted](https://github.com/golang/go/labels/help%20wanted)).    

<br> 

### Language changes
 
Let's start with the language changes that Go 1.10 brings. There are only a
couple of rather small changes, none of them significant.

First, you'll be able to use an untyped constant as the index of an expression
` x[1.0 << s]` where ` s ` is the untyped constant
[CL 60230](https://golang.org/cl/60230)

The second change is that you can now use method expressions like this
` struct{io.Reader}.Read `, even if this is a rather unusual way to do so
[CL 73233](https://golang.org/cl/73233)

<br>

### Operating systems support

Moving on to the operating system support, Go 1.10 will be the last Go version
to run on OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, OS X 10.9 Mavericks, or on OpenBSD 6.0.

FreeBSD 10.3 is now required to run Go, up from FreeBSD 9.3
[CL 64910](https://golang.org/cl/64910)

NetBSD is once again supported, but only in the unreleased version 8 and on
` 386 ` and ` amd64 `. ` arm ` support for NetBSD 8 was still broken at the time
of writing, see [Issue 23073](https://golang.org/issue/23073)

On 32-bit MIPS systems you can now choose if you want emulation for floating
point instructions or not via a new environment variable settings
` GOMIPS=hardfloat ` (the default) and ` GOMIPS=softfloat `
[CL 37954](https://golang.org/cl/37954)

<br>

### Tooling

The bigger changes in Go 1.10 come from the tooling improvements it brings. They
dramatically improve the quality of life for testing in large and very large
projects and pave the road towards Go 2.0.

<br>

#### Environment variables

Since Go 1.9,` GOROOT ` is inferred from the location of the ` go ` tool binary
by default. However, if your application relied on that value at runtime via
` runtime.GOROOT() ` there was a bug which prevented it have the correct
location. As of Go 1.10+ this bug was fixed and you can now use it as expected
[CL 61310](https://golang.org/cl/61310)

A couple of new environment variables were added to the ` go ` command.
` GOTMPDIR ` will allow you to configure where the temporary files created by Go
during compilation of your applications are stored. The default path is the same
as in the previous Go versions, the operating system's temporary files
directory. The other new environment variable is ` GOCACHE ` allows you to
control where the ` go ` command will store the cached information that's reused
in future builds [CL 75475](https://golang.org/cl/75475)

<br>

#### go build

` go build ` can now detect changes in files on a source code level rather than
rely on timestamps, which means that it will be more accurate in rebuilding the
packages that have changed. In turn, this means that you will now be able to
drop the usage of ` -a ` flag, which was previously used to force Go to rebuild
packages in certain conditions.

Changes are coming to the ` -asmflags`, ` -gcflags `, ` -gccgoflags `, and
` -ldflags ` flags. They will not be applied automatically to the list of all
packages as before but only to the direct package that's being specified in the
` build ` command. You can still achieve the same functionality as before using
the new special syntax for these flags, ` -ldflags=pattern=flags ` such as:  
` go build -ldflags=cmd/gofmt=-X=main.version=1.2.3 cmd/... `. This command
allows you to build all the ` /cmd/... ` packages but it will apply the
` -ldflags=-X=main.version=1.2.3 ` flag only to the ` cmd/gofmt ` package
[CL 76551](https://golang.org/cl/76551)

To further speed up the builds, ` go build -i ` will not be necessary since now
the build tool will have its own cache for build steps that do not do the
install step, such as ` go install ` or ` go get `. This means that you'll be
able to switch between branches or experiment a lot more with the code without
having to invoke ` go install ` or ` go build -i ` but just ` go build `.

Are you a Windows user? Now you can use c-shared as a target for your
libraries, thanks to [CL 69091](https://golang.org/cl/69091).

<br>

#### go install

` go install ` also received some changes. Now it will install only the
explicitly mentioned packages but not their dependencies. To restore the
previous behaviour, you'll need to use this command as ` go install -i `
[CL 75850](https://golang.org/cl/75850)

This change as well as upcoming changes is significant if your tools depend on
the packages to be installed in ` $GOPATH/pkg ` and always be fresh, with
additional changes being required in order to restore the old behaviour.

<br>

#### go test

Speaking of caching, ` go test ` has seen a lot of changes as well. One of the
most important is that ` go test ` will now cache the results of the tests if
they meet certain criteria such as:

- the test executable and command line match a previous run
- the files and environment variables used by that run have not changed 
- the results are successful
- the ` go test ` command received a list of packages to test, ` go test ./... `
for example
- the test command line uses a subset of the test flags, ` -cpu `, ` -list `,
` -parallel `, ` -run `, ` -short `, and ` -v `

When the above conditions are met, the first run will produce the output as
expected then subsequent runs will simply reuse that output. The run time of the
tests will also notify that the cached output is used, by displaying ` (cached) `
instead of the original test run time.

You can always force the tests to run by specifying the flag ` -count=1 `, this
being considered the idiomatic way to handle this requirement. As a recap, the
` -count ` flag allows you to specify how many times a test or a benchmark runs.

This change is covered in [CL 75631](https://golang.org/cl/75631).

The second important change to ` go test ` is that now a subset of ` go vet `
checks will run before the tests run in order to detect issues with your code.
These checks will be treated as build failures in case any of them will produce
any result. Only very high accuracy checks are included in this step. To disable
this new behavior you'll need to provide the ` -vet=off ` flag to the `go test `
command [CL 74356](https://golang.org/cl/74356)

The coverage profile of tests can now be created when running the tests against
multiple packages, which was a highly requested feature. Combined with the new
way to use the ` -coverpkg ` flag, it means you'll be able to get the coverage
for all the packages tested packages as well as their dependencies when multiple
packages are being tested by running
` go test -coverpkg=all -coverprofile cover.out ./... ` 
[CL 76875](https://golang.org/cl/76875) and
[CL 76876](https://golang.org/cl/76876)

Test binaries will now always write to ` stdout ` when invoked via ` go test `
whereas before ` stderr ` could have been used sometimes
[CL 76871](https://golang.org/cl/76871)

Tests running in parallel will now be better delimited by having ` PAUSE ` and
` CONT ` as status update lines when running with ` -v ` flag. This change
allows tooling to better interpret the start and stop of parallel tests. The 
` -failfast ` flag now will stop testing immediately on the first failure, with
the caveat that parallel tests are still allowed to continue until they finish
[CL 74450](https://golang.org/cl/74450)

Finally, ` go test -json ` will now output the format of the tests in json so
that tooling such as IDEs can better present the results of the test. There is
also a new command, ` go tool test2json ` that will produce convert the test
output to json [CL 76873](https://golang.org/cl/76873) and
[CL 76872](https://golang.org/cl/76872)

<br>

#### gofmt

Another set of tooling changes in Go 1.10 come from ` gofmt ` as it received
a few updates. First, three index slice expressions containing complex
expressions are now always formatted as ` slice[start+1 : stop : capacity] `
[CL 67633](https://golang.org/cl/67633)

The second change is that single-method interface literals written on a single
line, which are sometimes used in type assertions, are no longer split onto
multiple lines [CL 66130](https://golang.org/cl/66130)

The third one is that if a composite literal would include a comment and only
comments, then the comment(s) will now be indented
[CL 74232](https://golang.org/cl/74232) 

If you use ` gofmt ` in your CI environment, you will see some failures because
of these changes. The official position is that ` gofmt ` is not covered by the
same set of compatibility promises as Go 1 itself, so these are not "breaking
changes" but it's rather a constant evolving specification, which can suffer
changes on each new Go release. The recommendation is not to have ` gofmt `
enforced in the CI or have everyone use the same binary version for the
application that formats your source code as well as checks it in the CI system.

A good news is that now all flags supported by ` gofmt ` are supported by
` go fmt ` as well.

<br>

#### go fix

` go fix ` now replaces imports from ` golang.org/x/net/context ` with
` context ` which will help you migrate your code to a Go 1.9+ compatible code
by running ` go tool fix -r context your/package `
[CL 58590](https://golang.org/cl/58590)

<br>

#### pprof

Go 1.10 will also bring an update to the ` pprof ` tool. This brings a host of
improvements, among which an updated UI featuring a flame graph representation
of the profiling data [CL 75870](https://golang.org/cl/75870)

<br>

### Runtime

Go's runtime received a few updates, with the first one I'll cover being done
on how the ` LockOSThread ` and ` UnlockOSThread ` mechanism works. If before,
in nested calls, ` UnlockOSThread ` would need to be called only once to unlock
the thread, now it will need to be called as many times as ` LockOSThread ` was
called [CL 45752](https://golang.org/cl/45752)

You may have noticed the ` <autogenerated> ` frame (line) in the stack traces
before. This is now hidden, unless a panic or other issue happens in it. This
also means that if your code would call ` runtime.Caller ` with a certain number
of skip frames, then this change will be a "breaking change" in its behaviour as
the ` <autogenerated> ` frames will not be counted there either
[CL 45412](https://golang.org/cl/45412)

Another important change in the Go runtime is the introduction of soft and hard
goals (limits) for garbage collection [CL 59970](https://golang.org/cl/59970)

The soft limit is the current value of the GOGC while the hard limit is 10%
higher than the soft limit. Heavy GC reliant applications (so far only
benchmarks) shows that there's an increase in the heap size of the application.

<br>

### CGO support

CGO support has also received updates, with C typedefs such as ` typedef X Y ` 
now which means you'll be able to use ` C.X ` and ` C.Y ` interchangeably in Go
now, as if they would be Go aliases, ` type X = Y `
[CL 62670](https://golang.org/cl/62670)

Another welcomed change when working with C and Go is that you can now pass Go
strings directly to C. This is done by declaring a C function in a Go file with
a parameter type of the special type name ` _GoString_ `. To access the string
length, you'll need to call ` size_t _GoStringLen(_GoString_ s) ` an in order to
get the pointer to the string contents, you'll need use
`const char *_GoStringPtr(_GoString_ s) `
[CL 70890](https://golang.org/cl/70890)

Some C types that were previously mapped to a pointer type in Go are now mapped
to ` uintptr ` type. A couple of these types are ` CFTypeRef ` in Darwin's
CoreFoundation framework and the ` jobject ` in Java's JNI interface. You'll
need to initialize the values for the affected types with ` 0 ` instead of
` nil ` This is a breaking change but thankfully you can fix this quickly and
automatically by running ` go tool fix -r cftype your/package ` or
` go tool fix -r jni your/package ` [CL 66332](https://golang.org/cl/66332)
and [CL 81876](https://golang.org/cl/81876)

<br>

### Debugging

Debugging support has also been improved in the latest release which should make
your debugging experience via [Delve](https://github.com/derekparker/delve) even
better than before. And as a reminder, Delve is most likely integrated with your
favorite code editor. 

<br>

### Assembly support

Assembly support got better as well, with a host of new instructions being
added. Most important changes are under amd64 platform with 359 new instructions
including the full AVX, AVX2, BMI, BMI2, F16C, FMA3, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1,
and SSE4.2 extension sets.

<br>

### Packages

Changes in the various standard library packages:

- [bufio](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bufio) - the new
[Reader.Size](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bufio/#Reader.Size) and
[Writer.Size](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bufio/#Writer.Size) and methods report
the [Reader](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bufio/#Reader) or
[Writer](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bufio/#Writer)'s underlying buffer size
[CL 75150](https://golang.org/cl/75150)

- [bytes](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bytes/) - the
[Fields](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bytes/#Fields),
[FieldsFunc](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bytes/#FieldsFunc),
[Split](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bytes/#Split), and
[SplitAfter](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/bytes/#SplitAfter) each
already returned slices pointing into the same underlying array as its input.
Go 1.10 changes each of the returned subslices to have capacity equal to its
length, so that appending to a subslice will not overwrite adjacent data in the
original input. This is also a "breaking change" in the behavior of these
functions and you might need to update your code.

- [crypto/tls](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/) - the TLS server now
advertises support for SHA-512 signatures when using TLS 1.2. The server already
supported the signatures, but some clients would not select them unless
explicitly advertised [CL 74950](https://golang.org/cl/74950) 

- [crypto/x509](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/crypto/x509/) - leaf certificate
validation now enforces the name constraints for all names contained in the
certificate, not just the one name that a client has asked about. Extended key
usage restrictions are similarly now checked all at once. As a result, after a
certificate has been validated, now it can be trusted in its entirety. It is no
longer necessary to revalidate the certificate for each additional name or key
usage [CL 62693](https://golang.org/cl/62693)

- [database/sql/driver](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/database/sql/driver/) -
drivers that want to construct a ` sql.DB ` for their clients can now implement
the ` Connector ` interface and call the new ` sql.OpenDB ` function, instead of
needing to encode all configuration into a string passed to ` sql.Open `.
Drivers that want to parse the configuration string only once per ` sql.DB `
instead of once per ` sql.Conn `, or that want access to each ` sql.Conn `'s
underlying context, can make their ` Driver ` implementations also implement
` DriverContext `'s new ` OpenConnector ` method. Drivers that implement
` ExecerContext ` no longer need to implement ` Execer `; similarly, drivers
that implement ` QueryerContext ` no longer need to implement ` Queryer `.
Previously, even if the context-based interfaces were implemented they were
ignored unless the non-context-based interfaces were also implemented. To allow
drivers to better isolate different clients using a cached driver connection in
succession, if a ` Conn ` implements the new ` SessionResetter ` interface,
` database/sql ` will now call ` ResetSession ` before reusing the ` Conn ` for
a new client

- [encoding/json](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/) - the Decoder adds
a new method DisallowUnknownFields that causes it to report inputs with unknown
JSON fields as a decoding error. The default behavior has always been to discard
unknown fields. [CL 27231](https://golang.org/cl/27231) Unmarshal can no longer
decode into fields inside embedded pointers to unexported struct types, because
it cannot initialize the unexported embedded pointer to point at fresh storage.
Unmarshal now returns an error in this case. This means you may need to update
your code or a "breaking change" will happen, which could be hidden if the code
is not properly handling errors [CL 76851](https://golang.org/cl/76851)

- [text/template](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/text/template/) and
[html/template](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/html/template/) - the new actions
` {{break}} ` and ` {{continue}} ` break out of the innermost ` {{range ...}} `
loop, like the corresponding Go statements
[CL 66410](https://golang.org/cl/66410)

- [math/rand](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/math/rand/) - the new
[math/rand.Shuffle](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/math/rand/#Shuffle) function and
corresponding
[math/rand.*Rand.Shuffle](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/math/rand/#Rand.Shuffle)
method shuffle an input sequence [CL 51891](https://golang.org/cl/51891)

- [math](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/math/) - the new functions
[Round](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/math/#Round) and
[RoundToEven](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/math/#RoundToEven) round their
arguments to the nearest floating-point integer; ` Round ` rounds a half-integer
to its larger integer neighbor (away from zero) while ` RoundToEven ` rounds a
half-integer to its even integer neighbor
[CL 43652](https://golang.org/cl/43652) and
[CL 61211](https://golang.org/cl/61211)

- [net](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/net/) - the ` Conn ` and ` Listener `
implementations in this package now guarantee that when ` Close ` returns, the
underlying file descriptor has been closed. In earlier releases, if the
` Close ` stopped pending I/O in other goroutines, the closing of the file
descriptor could happen in one of those goroutines shortly after ` Close `
returned. ` TCPListener ` and ` UnixListener ` now implement ` syscall.Conn `,
to allow setting options on the underlying file descriptor using
` syscall.RawConn.Control `. The ` Conn ` implementations returned by ` Pipe `
now support setting read and write deadlines. The ` IPConn.ReadMsgIP `,
` IPConn.WriteMsgIP `, ` UDPConn.ReadMsgUDP `, and ` UDPConn.WriteMsgUDP `,
methods are now implemented on Windows

- [net/http](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/net/http/) - on the client side, an HTTP
proxy, most commonly configured by ` ProxyFromEnvironment `, can now be
specified as an ` https:// ` URL, meaning that the client connects to the proxy
over HTTPS before issuing a standard, proxied HTTP request. Previously, HTTP
proxy URLs were required to begin with ` http:// ` or ` socks5:// `. On the
server side, ` FileServer ` and its single-file equivalent ServeFile now apply
` If-Range ` checks to ` HEAD ` requests. ` FileServer ` also now reports
directory read failures to the ` Server `'s ` ErrorLog `. The content-serving
handlers also now omit the ` Content-Type ` header when serving zero-length
content. ` ResponseWriter `'s ` WriteHeader ` method now panics if passed an
invalid (non-3-digit) status code. ` Redirect ` now sets the Content-Type header
before writing its HTTP response

- [net/url](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/net/url/) - ` ResolveReference ` now
preserves multiple leading slashes in the target URL. Previously it rewrote
multiple leading slashes to a single slash, which resulted in the
` http.Client ` following certain redirects incorrectly

- [os](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os/) - ` File ` adds new methods
[SetDeadline](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os/#File.SetDeadline),
[SetReadDeadline](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os/#File.SetReadDeadline), and
[SetWriteDeadline](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/os/#File.SetWriteDeadline) that
allow setting I/O deadlines when the underlying file descriptor supports
non-blocking I/O operations [CL 71770](https://golang.org/cl/71770) The
definition of these  methods matches those in ` net.Conn `. Also matching
` net.Conn `, ` File `'s ` Close ` method now guarantee that when ` Close `
returns, the underlying file descriptor has been closed

- [strings](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/strings/) - a new type
[Builder](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/strings/#Builder) is a replacement for
` bytes.Buffer ` for the use case of accumulating text into a string result. The
` Builder `'s API is a restricted subset of ` bytes.Buffer `'s that allows it to
safely avoid making a duplicate copy of the data during the String method
[CL 74931](https://golang.org/cl/74931)

- [unicode](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/unicode/) -  the ` unicode ` package and
associated support throughout the system has been upgraded from version 9.0 to
Unicode 10.0, which adds 8,518 new characters, including four new scripts, one
new property, a Bitcoin currency symbol, and 56 new emoji

A lot more packages have received changes but I've tried to keep the list to a
minimum. To view the full list of changes, you can read this the
[Draft Release Notes](https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.10).

<br>

### Closing notes

Due to the vast amount of changes both in compiler and in runtime, some
workloads are expected to perform better as of Go 1.10. However, I highly
recommend that you grab the latest Go 1.10 release,
[1.10 Beta 1](https://golang.org/dl/#unstable) and test it on your workloads,
run the tests against the new Go version and help the Go team identify issues
before Go 1.10 lands in February. There are a few weeks where even just running
the test / benchmark suite could make the difference. And Go 1.10 Beta 1 is also
available as a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/golang/) so you can
minimize the impact it has on your system.    

If you want to stay up to date with the developments of Go, I recommend 
following [@golang_cls](https://twitter.com/golang_cls) Twitter account which
provides a curated list of interesting commits as they are added to Go.

If you want to talk more about Go, its evolution, and what's next for Go,
[tweet me](https://twitter.com/dlsniper), or meet me at
[Gophercon Iceland](https://gophercon.is)!

Finally, I would like to thank the Go Team and all contributors that helped Go
reach 1.10 and I look forward to what the future holds.

A big thank you goes to Russ Cox and the team that created the initial draft
documentation which this article uses / reuses a lot. 

Errata:

The initial version of this article incorrectly mentioned a change about how
GOROOT is handled. Thank you to
