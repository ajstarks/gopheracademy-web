It's November, and once again our thoughts drift towards the holidays and the awesome blog posts that arrive as gifts to you in the Gopher Academy Blog.  We'd love to have YOUR contributions this year so we're sending out our request for people to sign up for a blog post in December.

It's a fun process, and you'll have help and support from editors along the way.  If you're ready to write a post for our Advent series, you can signup [online](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HjldwvQzJFvaVf-2Em1O-s--soXZzqyXmwkZkrw7nhw/edit?usp=sharing).  Articles are written in Markdown format, so you don't need to worry about any fancy formatting. Just bring your awesome ideas and share them with the world.

We'd love blog posts of all types as long as they're related to Go.  Introduce us to your new project or package!  Write a how-to on using your favorite package or tool!  Propose a radical new change for Go 2.0!  We can't wait to see what you'll write.

Brian
