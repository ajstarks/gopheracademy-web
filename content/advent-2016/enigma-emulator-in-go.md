# Introduction

This story begins the day after I got home after giving a talk at the wonderful
[DevFest Siberia](http://devfest.gdg.org.ru/). Shortly after my weekly fix of
Westworld, a strange nagging feeling appeared — like the one you get from unpaid
bills, a postcard that you forgot to send, or a particularly nasty API endpoint
that you were supposed to refactor a year ago but then, well, I mean, it works,
right?

Then I remembered. I emptied out my suitcase and found the cause of the
uneasiness: two stickers with goofy cartoon gophers on them. The first one was
really enjoying their beer. The other one has just put on a wizard hat —
possibly matched with a robe. They were looking right into my eyes.

The first rule of IT conferences is simple: if someone gives you a sticker, you
must try the product. Everyone knows that. People place great trust in you by
handing out these colorful pieces of adhesive paper, and doing nothing about my
new gopher friends would be outright criminal. I had to write something in Go.

An Enigma emulator is a reasonably solid choice for getting a first impression
of a programming language: it is fundamentally simple, but nuanced enough to get
familiar with at least a few language quirks by the time it is done. I have set
aside a couple afternoons and a weekend — and it turned out to be enough to get
from zero to a fully documented reusable Enigma library with a CLI app.

Go is surprisingly easy to learn on a basic level — as long as you have some
programming experience and, ideally, know a thing or two about pointers. Enigma,
on the other hand, is a bit more challenging. Mainly, I will try to describe how
Enigma works, and then provide the Go code implementing the parts.

What if you know nothing about Go at all? What if Enigma for you is a strange
box where magic happens (and also Benedict Cumberbatch is somehow involved)?
Well, that is just awesome — it means I have a chance to get you curious about
both of these things!

The full library — along with a CLI app that is not covered in this post — is
available at [github.com/emedvedev/enigma](https://github.com/emedvedev/enigma).
Naturally, there is a [GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/emedvedev/enigma)
page as well.

Let's begin!



# Enigma 101

![](/postimages/advent-2016/enigma-emulator-in-go/enigma.png)

There are quite a few excellent articles and even entire websites explaining how
Enigma works in great detail ([Tony
Sale's](http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/enigma/index.htm) is probably my
favorite), so I will only give a very basic explanation before we move to the
coding, leaving nuances to serious Enigma-focused publications.

Enigma is a rotor-based machine: each letter is encoded by an electric signal
going through a number of _rotors_ (they can be seen on the picture), with each
rotor performing a letter substitution. Most importantly, one or more rotors
would move before encoding, changing the substitution alphabet with every
subsequent character.

After the first pass through the rotors, the signal goes through a _reflector_:
it performs one more substitution and sends the signal back through the rotors,
this time in reverse order. You can see the reflector to the left of the rotors,
marked with "B" to denote its wiring (several different reflectors were in use).

To scramble the message even further, a _plugboard_ is used to make letter pairs
that will be swapped both before and after encoding. You can see the connected
pairs on the image above (takes some effort unless you were really into "help
the rabbit get to carrots" puzzles as a kid): some of them are IO, PT, EW, and
RQ, so if your input is "GOPHER", it is transformed to "GITHWQ" before being
encoded. The same swap is applied to the encoded letters right before output.

A wiring diagram should make things clearer:

![](/postimages/advent-2016/enigma-emulator-in-go/wiring.png)

If things are still unclear, you can practice on a [papercraft Enigma compatible
with a 165g Pringles
tube](https://fhcouk.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/pringlesenigma3a4.pdf).

Now that we know the basics, we can start with some boilerplate code:

```
package enigma

import "bytes"

type Enigma struct {
	// We'll get to those later.
	Reflector Reflector
	Plugboard Plugboard
	Rotors    Rotors
}

func (e *Enigma) EncodeChar(letter byte) byte {
	// This is where magic happens! Wow!
	// 1. Move the rotors.
	// 2. Swap the input character if there is a plugboard pair.
	// 3. Step into each rotor (right to left).
	// 4. Step into the reflector.
	// 5. Step into each rotor (left to right).
	// 6. Swap the result if there is a plugboard pair.
	// 7. Return the result.
}

func (e *Enigma) EncodeString(text string) string {
	var result bytes.Buffer
	for i := range text {
		result.WriteByte(e.EncodeChar(text[i]))
	}
	return result.String()
}
```

Footnote: using runes would be more semantically correct than bytes, I guess,
but we only encrypt ASCII, so it's fine. The real reason behind using bytes is
that they've turned out to work a little faster when I had to run eleven million
Enigma configurations.



# Initial configuration

![](/postimages/advent-2016/enigma-emulator-in-go/keysheet.jpg)

To decrypt an Enigma-encoded message, you must know the configuration that was
used to encrypt it. Enigma configurations were distributed on key sheets, like
the one above, and changed daily. For obvious reasons, key sheets were
considered top secret information and highly protected. Only the officers were
trusted with them, and they were often required to configure the machines
personally and lock the insides so that even the operators did not know the
settings.

Here is what a daily entry consisted of:

- "IV V I" (Walzenlage) is the rotors order. Eight rotors with different wiring
  were supplied with the machines, the three rotors in use (and their order)
  would change every day.
- "21 15 16" (Ringstellung) is the ring setting. Every rotor had a configurable
  "ring" that would shift the encryption alphabet by a given amount (1 to 26).
- "KL IT ... SE OG" (Steckerverbindungen) are the plugboard pairs, already
  described in a previous section.

- "jkm ... glp" (Kenngruppen) are the key groups: they were used to communicate
  the starting positions of the rotors. [The procedure for using
  keys](http://users.telenet.be/d.rijmenants/en/enigmaproc.htm) has nothing to
  do with the Enigma machine itself — the operators did it — so the only part
  that matters is being able to set the initial rotor positions.

Now that we know the settings that were used, let's take a look at the
constructor:

```
type RotorConfig struct {
	ID    string
	Start byte
	Ring  int
}

func NewEnigma(rotorConfiguration []RotorConfig, refID string, plugs []string) *Enigma {
	// More magic!
	// 1. Get the rotor models by their UIDs ("I" to "VIII") and load the parameters.
	// 2. Create a plugboard mapping from the supplied pairs.
	// 3. Get the reflector by its UID.
	// 4. Return the new Enigma instance.
}
```

I know there is still a lot of magic and boilerplates, but bear with me:
including the implementation details would be too confusing at this point. Think
of it as a progressive JPEG kind of thing.

A lot of real code in the next section though!



# Rotors

![](/postimages/advent-2016/enigma-emulator-in-go/rotors.jpg)

Rotors were the heart of the Enigma machines. Essentially, each rotor performs a
simple letter substitution according to its internal wiring:

```
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
||||||||||||||||||||||||||
EKMFLGDQVZNTOWYHXUSPAIBRCJ
```

When the signal goes towards a reflector (from right to left), "A" is encoded to
"E", and then the signal goes on to the next rotor. After the reflector, the
signal gets reversed: "A" would be encrypted to "U".

As mentioned before, the rotor parts are movable. When the rotor is moved, the
substitution table gets offset:

```
BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZA
||||||||||||||||||||||||||
EKMFLGDQVZNTOWYHXUSPAIBRCJ
```

Now it is "B", not "A", that encodes to "E".

The operator could set the starting position for each rotor manually, and just
like every other configuration parameter, starting positions were changed daily
during the war.

A _ring setting_ (set through a small ring on the rotor) would add a fixed
offset: with the starting position "B" and the ring setting 4, the table would
have an offset of three positions.

Another important part is stepping — moving rules for the rotors. We will get to
it after we are done with the rest of the parts, but for now it is important to
know that rotors had notches next to one of the letters (rotors V through VIII
had two), and when Enigma "encountered" that notch, the rotor on the left was
shifted. On the picture above, the rotor on the left has a visible notch at H,
and the rotor on the right has a notch at U.

Let's create a simple type for the rotors:

```
type Rotor struct {
	ID          string
	StraightSeq [26]int
	ReverseSeq  [26]int
	Turnover    []int

	Offset int
	Ring   int
}

type Rotors []Rotor
```

Note that letter sequences are `[26]int`: inside the library, we are going to be
working with `int` values for letters (`0` for `'A'`, `25` for `'Z'`), rather
than bytes or runes. We do not care about the characters themselves when
performing the encoding — their position and offset matter much more — so we are
saving ourselves from a bunch of extra `rune`/`int` conversions during the
encoding process.

We still have to perform the conversion in constructors, so here are the two
helper functions:

```
func CharToIndex(char byte) int {
	return int(char - 'A')
}

func IndexToChar(index int) byte {
	return byte('A' + index)
}
```

Curiously, the reason something like this works is that `rune` is an alias for
`int32` in Go; there is [a useful post in The Go
Blog](https://blog.golang.org/strings) on characters, bytes, and strings that I
would recommend.

Let's define a constructor and create the eight preset rotors that were in use
at the time. A helper method for the rotor list to get rotors by ID is included
(although making `Rotors` a map instead of a list is also an option):

```
func NewRotor(mapping string, id string, turnovers string) *Rotor {
	r := &Rotor{ID: id, Offset: 0, Ring: 0}
	r.Turnover = make([]int, len(turnovers))
	for i := range turnovers {
		r.Turnover[i] = CharToIndex(turnovers[i])
	}
	for i, letter := range mapping {
		index := CharToIndex(byte(letter))
		r.StraightSeq[i] = index
		r.ReverseSeq[index] = i
	}
	return r
}

func (rs *Rotors) GetByID(id string) *Rotor {
	for _, rotor := range *rs {
		if rotor.ID == id {
			return &rotor
		}
	}
	return nil
}

var HistoricRotors = Rotors{
	*NewRotor("EKMFLGDQVZNTOWYHXUSPAIBRCJ", "I", "Q"),
	*NewRotor("AJDKSIRUXBLHWTMCQGZNPYFVOE", "II", "E"),
	*NewRotor("BDFHJLCPRTXVZNYEIWGAKMUSQO", "III", "V"),
	*NewRotor("ESOVPZJAYQUIRHXLNFTGKDCMWB", "IV", "J"),
	*NewRotor("VZBRGITYUPSDNHLXAWMJQOFECK", "V", "Z"),
	*NewRotor("JPGVOUMFYQBENHZRDKASXLICTW", "VI", "ZM"),
	*NewRotor("NZJHGRCXMYSWBOUFAIVLPEKQDT", "VII", "ZM"),
	*NewRotor("FKQHTLXOCBJSPDZRAMEWNIUYGV", "VIII", "ZM"),
}
```

Finally, the method performing the substitution. We need to account for the
current position and the ring settings — this is one of the examples where
thinking of letters as their indexes helps us avoid unnecessary conversions:

```
func (r *Rotor) Step(letter int, invert bool) int {
	letter = (letter - r.Ring + r.Offset + 26) % 26
	if invert {
		letter = r.ReverseSeq[letter]
	} else {
		letter = r.StraightSeq[letter]
	}
	letter = (letter + r.Ring - r.Offset + 26) % 26
	return letter
}
```

Another footnote: I tried to make my Go code as idiomatic as possible by
applying the best method I know, which is looking up my stupid questions on
Stack Overflow and copying the answers if they are written by Dave Cheney.
However, despite this tremendous effort, there are bound to be some ugly parts —
please do point them out.

# Reflectors

A reflector (also known as a reversing drum or UKW) performs a simple letter
swap — "M" to "N", "N" to "M" — with the letter pairs hardwired. A configurable
reflector, UKW-D, has been introduced in 1944, but was rare enough to ignore in
our emulator.

Same as with rotors, we'll store a `[26]int` mapping, but since the letters are
swapped in pairs, we can do without the reverse map. A common representation of
a reflector is a mapping string (`YRUHQSLDPXNGOKMIEBFZCWVJAT`), so we'll make
the constructor accept it:

```
type Reflector struct {
	ID       string
	Sequence [26]int
}

func NewReflector(mapping string, id string) *Reflector {
	var seq [26]int
	for i, value := range mapping {
		seq[i] = ToInt(byte(value))
	}
	return &Reflector{id, seq}
}
```

The `Reflectors` type for the list and the GetByID method for reflectors are
nearly identical to those of the rotors, so I will not provide them here.

Lastly, we will need a preset. Two reflectors, B and C (with C being rare and
almost unused), were used in the M3 machines:

```
var HistoricReflectors = Reflectors{
	*NewReflector("YRUHQSLDPXNGOKMIEBFZCWVJAT", "B"),
	*NewReflector("FVPJIAOYEDRZXWGCTKUQSBNMHL", "C"),
}
```

Reflectors provided symmetry to Enigma machines: a path from "A" to "Z" would be
the same as the path from "Z" to "A". Because of that, encryption and decryption
were essentially the same. However, because of reflectors, letters could never
be encoded into themselves — a serious flaw that was heavily exploited by
codebreakers.

# Plugboard

We're almost ready to encode all the things! Only the plugboard is missing, and
since a simple letter swap is all it does, we can define it as `[26]int` and map
unspecified letters to themselves in the constructor:

```
type Plugboard [26]int

func NewPlugboard(pairs []string) *Plugboard {
	p := Plugboard{}
	for i := 0; i < 26; i++ {
		p[i] = i
	}
	for _, pair := range pairs {
		if len(pair) > 0 {
			var intFirst = ToInt(pair[0])
			var intSecond = ToInt(pair[1])
			p[intFirst] = intSecond
			p[intSecond] = intFirst
		}
	}
	return &p
}
```

That is it. Really simple.

# Rotor stepping

There is only one thing left to do before we can stuff that boilerplate method
in the `Enigma` type with code: learn how to move the rotors.

The rules are as follows:

1. Rotors move on a keypress, but _before_ a character is encoded.
2. The right rotor always moves.
3. If the rotor moves from a notch position, a rotor on its left moves.
4. If the middle rotor advances the left rotor, the middle rotor
   moves again at the next step.

The last rule is called _double stepping_, and it is, admittedly, hella
confusing. The reason is that it was not the intended design, but rather an
engineering flaw. Since most Enigma machines share this property — including the
M3 — we have to emulate it as well.

These principles are not hard to describe as code — and we will create a couple
more helper methods to keep the `Enigma` method itself lightweight and readable:

```
func (r *Rotor) move(offset int) {
	r.Offset = (r.Offset + offset) % 26
}

func (r *Rotor) ShouldTurnOver() bool {
	for _, turnover := range r.Turnover {
		if r.Offset == turnover {
			return true
		}
	}
	return false
}

func (e *Enigma) moveRotors() {
	var (
		rotorLen            = len(e.Rotors)
		farRight            = e.Rotors[rotorLen-1]
		farRightTurnover    = farRight.ShouldTurnOver()
		secondRight         = e.Rotors[rotorLen-2]
		secondRightTurnover = secondRight.ShouldTurnOver()
		thirdRight          = e.Rotors[rotorLen-3]
	)
	if secondRightTurnover {
		if !farRightTurnover {
			secondRight.move(1)
		}
		thirdRight.move(1)
	}
	if farRightTurnover {
		secondRight.move(1)
	}
	farRight.move(1)
}
```

Nevermind the variable naming: `secondRight` and `thirdRight` could be `middle`
and `left` on M3, but the library also supports M4 that has four rotors, so it
would be incorrect.

Congratulations! Everything inside our Enigma is working as it is supposed to.

# Wiring it all together

![](/postimages/advent-2016/enigma-emulator-in-go/cli.png)

The `Enigma` constructor and the boilerplate `encodeChar` method we have created
at the very beginning are all that is still left unfinished, and now we have
everything we need to complete the machine:

```
func (e *Enigma) EncodeChar(letter byte) byte {
	// This is where magic happens! Wow!

	// 1. Move the rotors.
	e.moveRotors()

	// 2. Swap the input character if there is a plugboard pair.
	letterIndex := CharToIndex(letter)
	letterIndex = e.Plugboard[letterIndex]

	// 3. Step into each rotor (right to left).
	for i := len(e.Rotors) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
		letterIndex = e.Rotors[i].Step(letterIndex, false)
	}

	// 4. Step into the reflector.
	letterIndex = e.Reflector.Sequence[letterIndex]

	// 5. Step into each rotor (left to right).
	for i := 0; i < len(e.Rotors); i++ {
		letterIndex = e.Rotors[i].Step(letterIndex, true)
	}

	// 6. Swap the result if there is a plugboard pair.
	letterIndex = e.Plugboard[letterIndex]
	letter = IndexToChar(letterIndex)

	// 7. Return the result.
	return letter
}

func NewEnigma(rotorConfiguration []RotorConfig, refID string, plugs []string) *Enigma {
	// More magic!

	// 1. Get the rotor models by their UIDs ("I" to "VIII") and load the parameters.

	// 2. Create a plugboard mapping from the supplied pairs.
	// 3. Get the reflector by its UID.
	// 4. Return the new Enigma instance.
}
```

Magic! Let's import the library and test it:

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/emedvedev/enigma"
)

func main() {
	e := enigma.NewEnigma(
		[]enigma.RotorConfig{
			enigma.RotorConfig{ID: "III", Start: 'A', Ring: 1},
			enigma.RotorConfig{ID: "II", Start: 'B', Ring: 1},
			enigma.RotorConfig{ID: "IV", Start: 'C', Ring: 1},
		},
		"B",
		[]string{"AB", "CD", "EF"},
	)
	plaintext := "HELLOWORLD"
	ciphertext := e.EncodeString(plaintext)

	fmt.Printf("%s is encoded as %s\n", plaintext, ciphertext)

	e2 := enigma.NewEnigma(
		[]enigma.RotorConfig{
			enigma.RotorConfig{ID: "III", Start: 'A', Ring: 1},
			enigma.RotorConfig{ID: "II", Start: 'B', Ring: 1},
			enigma.RotorConfig{ID: "IV", Start: 'C', Ring: 1},
		},
		"B",
		[]string{"AB", "CD", "EF"},
	)

	plaintext2 := ciphertext
	ciphertext2 := e2.EncodeString(plaintext2)

	fmt.Printf("%s is encoded as %s\n", ciphertext, ciphertext2)
}
```

```
HELLOWORLD is encoded as YGMGTTPJNJ
YGMGTTPJNJ is encoded as HELLOWORLD
```

It's alive! We are officially done.

Now you can try encrypting and decrypting messages with other online emulators
for verification: for example,
[Universal Enigma](http://people.physik.hu-berlin.de/~palloks/js/enigma/enigma-u_v20_en.html)
supports a wide range of Enigma models and settings, and is overall amazing.

You could also use a real Enigma machine, of course: after all, there is nothing
better than original, and it will only run you down
[a meager sum of $365,000](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/23/rare-nazi-enigma-machine-sold-at-auction-for-world-record-365000).
You can't afford _not_ to buy it!

And of course, I just cannot recommend [the Pringles
Enigma](https://fhcouk.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/pringlesenigma3a4.pdf) enough
as a cheaper and a more functional alternative. You can eat and encode with the
same device! This is the future, right here.
