Calling all Gophers!

Many of you have asked how you can volunteer to help with GopherCon - and here's a great opportunity! We're doing our best to keep overhead costs down and apply the savings to an even better conference experience.  Here's where you come in...

GopherCon 2017 is right around the corner and we haven't created a website yet.  We're looking for a handful of Gophers to help build the site. Our goal is to be up and running by the New Year.  If you're interested, email Brian at bketelsen@gopheracademy.com to get the party started.
