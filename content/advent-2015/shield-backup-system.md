# Quick background: What is SHIELD?

[SHIELD][shield] is a backup solution for Cloud Foundry and BOSH deployed
services such as Redis, PostgreSQL, and Docker. (For the interested,
[here][CFBlogPost] is a quick summary of the basics of BOSH and Cloud
Foundry.) The original design was inspired by a client's need to have both
broad and granular backups of their private Cloud Foundry and its ecosystem.
Specifically, in addition to being able to recover from a meteor strike they
also wanted to be able to create more granular backups so they could restore
specific containers, credentials, databases, and so on. Since there was not
an existing backup solution of this type available for Cloud Foundry/etc.,
we designed a new solution named SHIELD.

# Functions as Fields in Structs

Something we employed both in the CLI and in the server-side code was the
ability to validate the received data to help keep out both non-sense and
malicious values. Since different fields were expected to have different
inputs, we ended up with several validation functions checking everything
from whether input is appropriately structured and valid JSON to checking
the values and types. There were so many different functions floating around
and we needed a way to consistently work them into the input validation
process.

The example code below is a scaled down version of the process. There are
the `Form` and `Field` structs, but there is also a function type declared
called `FieldValidator`. The `FieldValidator` type allows any function to be
stored in the `Validator` field as long as it (1) takes in a `string` and an
`int` and (2) outputs an `error`. You can see from the example that this
holds true not just for the named functions `InputIsNotBigEnough` and
`InputIsNotSmallEnough` but anonymous functions as well. The value in
`Value` is evaluated when the form is shown and instead of some complicated
legwork to match the appropriate validation functions to their field outside
the struct, I can just call the validation function stored in the struct as
`field.Validator`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type FieldValidator func(name string, value int) error

type Form struct {
	Fields []*Field
}

type Field struct {
	Name      string
	Value     int
	Validator FieldValidator
}

func NewForm() *Form {
	f := Form{}
	return &f
}

func (f *Form) NewField(name string, value int, fcn FieldValidator) error {
	f.Fields = append(f.Fields, &Field{Name: name, Value: value, Validator: fcn})
	return nil
}

func DateIsNotLateEnough(name string, value int) error {
	if value < 20151206 {
		return fmt.Errorf("date must be after 20151206")
	}
	return nil
}

func DateIsNotEarlyEnough(name string, value int) error {
	if value > 20151214 {
		return fmt.Errorf("date must be earlier than 20151214")
	}
	return nil
}

func (f *Form) Show() error {
	for _, field := range f.Fields {
		err := field.Validator(field.Name, field.Value)
		if err == nil {
			err = fmt.Errorf("date is correct")
		}
		fmt.Printf("name: '%s', value: '%d', validate: '%v'\n", field.Name, field.Value, err)
	}
	return nil
}

func main() {
	in := NewForm()
	in.NewField("Hanukkah", 20151205, DateIsNotLateEnough)
	in.NewField("Another day of Hanukkah", 20151215, DateIsNotEarlyEnough)
	in.NewField("Diwali", 20151111, func(n string, v int) error {
		if v != 20151111 {
			return fmt.Errorf("diwali must be 20151111")
		}
		return nil
	})
	in.Show()
}
```

# Using Interfaces with JSON

Some of you may be familiar with the concept of "function overloading". For
those who aren't, function overloading is when a language permits you to
create multiple functions with the same name. A trivial example might be to
create two `add` functions: one for adding ints and another for adding
floats. This allows you to avoid cluttering your code with function names
like `addInt` and `addFloat`.

BUT: [Go explicitly doesn't support function overloading][GoForCPP] (fourth
to last bullet point). They provide a quick explanation about why on their
FAQ page [here][GoFAQ]. And that's ok - we don't really need function
overloading to accomplish our goals. Why? Because we have interfaces!

In the SHIELD project we were mostly concerned with this for error handling
in JSON: we wanted to use a single function for writing JSON errors to the
client calling the API endpoint. Tying this into what we did above with
validation functions in structs, interfaces provided a consistent way to
pass JSON error payloads from different sources. Simplified example:

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
)

type JSONError interface {
	JSON() string
}

type MissingParametersError struct {
	Missing []string `json:"missing"`
}
func (e *MissingParametersError) Check(name string, value string) {
	if value == "" {
		e.Missing = append(e.Missing, name)
	}
}
func (e MissingParametersError) Error() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("missing: %v", e.Missing)
}
func (e MissingParametersError) JSON() string {
	b, err := json.Marshal(e)
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Sprintf(`{"error":"failed to unmarshal JSON: %s"}`, err)
	}
	return string(b)
}




type InvalidParametersError struct {
	Errors map[string]string `json:"invalid"`
}
func (e *InvalidParametersError) Validate(name string, value string, fn func(string, string) error) {
	err := fn(name, value)
	if err != nil {
		e.Errors[name] = err.Error()
	}
}
func (e InvalidParametersError) Error() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("invalid parameters: %v", e.Errors)
}
func (e InvalidParametersError) JSON() string {
	b, err := json.Marshal(e)
	if err != nil {
		return fmt.Sprintf(`{"error":"failed to unmarshal JSON: %s"}`, err)
	}
	return string(b)
}

func respond(e JSONError) {
	fmt.Printf("%s\n", e.JSON())
}

func main() {
	e1 := &MissingParametersError{}
	e1.Check("name",    "A Thing")
	e1.Check("summary", "")
	e1.Check("required", "")
	respond(e1)

	e2 := &InvalidParametersError{Errors: map[string]string{}}
	e2.Validate("number", "a string", func (name string, value string) error {
		return fmt.Errorf("%s: %v is not a number", name, value)
	})
	e2.Validate("value", "42", func(name string, value string) error {
		return fmt.Errorf("%s: %v is too small", name, value)
	})
	respond(e2)
}
```

# A Race Condition in the Pipes

First, what is a race condition?

> "A race condition occurs when one goroutine modifies a variable and
> another reads it or modifies it without any synchronization."
> *--[Source][race-def]*

The code that caused our race condition was a result of the way we had
originally tried to implement the backup and restore processes. SHIELD has
both target and store plugins so a user can select what type of data is
being backed up or restored (e.g. PostgreSQL) and what type of storage the
data is being backed up to or restored from (e.g. S3). To run the backups
and restores, we created stdin, stdout, stderr pipes for both the target and
store. In the case of a backup, the store read what was being sent by the
target (i.e. the target's standard output was piped into the store's
standard input). Likewise, during a restore the target read what was being
sent by the store (i.e. the store's standard output was piped into the
target's standard input).

While this conceptually makes sense and should work, we ran into issues
during testing when we started to see non-reproducible, inconsistent, and
seemingly random failures when we deployed the dev release to our testing
environment. Things like leaking pipes where not all the data from stdout
was making it to the corresponding stdin and corrupted archives. We upped
the ante on our testing adding in various payload sizes, random sleeps, etc.
but no matter what we did to our tests they still all passed. After our
attempts to expose the issues we were experiencing with tests failed, we
began to suspect we had created non-deterministic code. But how? To help
show what happened, here's a trimmed down example:

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"os/exec"
)

func Drain(prefix string, rd io.Reader) {
	b := bufio.NewScanner(rd)
	for b.Scan() {
		fmt.Printf("%s> %s\n", prefix, b.Text())
	}
}

func main() {
	/* <go> | ls -alh / | sort | <go> */
	ls := exec.Command("ls", "-alh", "/")
	sort := exec.Command("sort")

	/* grab standard error from both commands */
	err1, _ := ls.StderrPipe()
	err2, _ := sort.StderrPipe()

	/* wire up ls's stdout to sort's stdin */
	sort.Stdin, _ = ls.StdoutPipe()

	/* grab the output from the `sort' command */
	out, _ := sort.StdoutPipe()

	/* spin up two goroutines to stream errors */
	go Drain("error", err1)
	go Drain("error", err2)

	/* spin up a goroutine to stream output from `sort' */
	go Drain("output", out)

	_ = sort.Start()
	_ = ls.Start()

	_ = ls.Wait()
	_ = sort.Wait()
}
```

<small>Due to limitations in Go Playground this code must be run locally to
reproduce, please see [example code on Github][race-code].</small>

In this example, `ls` and `sort` are taking over the roles of `target` and
`store` from SHIELD. Skimming over the code you can see that it is going to
drain stdout and stderr into their respective pipes to `sort` the output of
the `ls` command. `sort.Start` is run first so that `sort` is ready to sort
the output of `ls`, similar to the way that store would wait to read the
output of target (or vice versa). At this point, `sort` is running in the
background and will continue to do so until its stdin is complete. Since
`sort.Stdin` is defined as `ls.StdoutPipe`, that means waiting for the
`ls.StdoutPipe` to complete. Then Go hits the `Wait` command. [Taking a look
at `Wait`][go-src-code] and then looking back at the code, we can see that
the descriptors that `Wait` needs to close before exiting are the read and
stdout pipes. This read is the same read that `Drain` is trying to read
(`rd`) from. Since `Wait` is trying to close what `Drain` is trying to read,
the program fails with a data race condition like so:

```

Found 2 data race(s)
```

Note that two data races are found - one for each of the goroutines draining
the stderr pipes.

Since this example is a lot simpler than the one we ran into in SHIELD it
still works in these sense that when you build the binary without the [data
race detector][race-dedect], `go build -race`, the code will compile and run
as expected. This is because you are essentially just running `ls | sort`
which, unless you have a truly massive set of subdirectories, should resolve
itself relatively quickly. The same cannot be said of of the similar data
race we created and found in SHIELD.

To see exactly how the race condition appeared in SHIELD at that time, take
a look at [task.go in commit 6020baa][task-6020baa]. When we researched our
data race, we discovered that it is a known problem with exec'ing certain
commands/pipes (see [here][race-1], [here][race-2], and [here][race-3]). As
a result, we ended up resolving the issue by implementing a [BASH
script][shield-bash] to handle the pipes. The first commit with this fix is
[3548036][commit-3548036]. Since then, the relevant go code has been
refactored into `request.go`.

# Open Invitation: Want to test and contribute to SHIELD?

To setup a local testing environment for SHIELD, please use the `setup-env`
script in our [testbed][shield-test] repository after [setting up a local
Cloud Foundry on BOSH Lite][bosh-lite]. Our testbed deploys Cloud Foundry
and docker-postgres with SHIELD and sets up some initial dummy values in
SHIELD itself.

The CLI is pretty straightforward - for example `shield create target` and
`shield list stores`. There are also some aliased commands, e.g. `shield ls`
for `shield list`. For a full list of commands, please take a look at the
CLI documentation on the project [README][shield-cli].

We welcome feedback and pull requests!
