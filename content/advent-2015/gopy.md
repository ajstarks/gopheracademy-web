Applications and libraries do not live in a vacuum.
This is of course true for `Go` packages and commands.
More often than not, you need your code to interact with legacy applications or
old and battle tested libraries.

The standard library of `Go` provides many facilities for interacting with such
entities: `encoding/json`, `encoding/xml` or `net/rpc`.
Reach out of the standard library and you have `ProtoBuf`.
All of these facilities meant to arrange for some kind of IPC (Inter-Program
Communication) and before `Go-1.5`, this was the only portable way to do so.


With `Go-1.5` and the new [execution
modes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nr-TQHw_er6GOQRsF6T43GGhFDelrAP0NqSS_00RgZQ/edit)
it is now possible to create `C` shared libraries from a `Go` package: that's
performed via the `-buildmode=c-shared` command-line option.
As you have seen in [libc-hooking-go-shared-libraries](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/advent-2015/libc-hooking-go-shared-libraries/), creating a `C` shared library is not particularly complicated but the process does involve a few steps.

[gopy](https://github.com/go-python/gopy) automates the drudgery work of
creating a `CPython-2` C-extension module out of a `Go` package: eventually
allowing you to write nice concurrent libraries in `Go` and share them with your
`CPython` friends.
Given a `Go` package, `gopy` will:

- inspects the `Go` package
- extracts the exported `types`, `funcs`, `vars` and `consts`
- creates a `cgo` package that exports these entities to `C`
- creates a `C` extension module, using the `CPython-2` API, calling these `cgo` exported entities
- compiles everything together into a `.so` shared object

## Installation

`gopy` is a pure-`Go` command and can thus be installed like so:

```sh
sh> go get github.com/go-python/gopy
```

Of course, at runtime, for `gopy` to be able to actually generate the `CPython`
extension module, it will need:

- the `python-dev` package (which contains the `CPython` development headers and
  `libpython.so.2.X`)
- `pkg-config` and the corresponding `python2.pc` configuration file which holds
  and describes the correct `C` incantation commands (`-I`, `-L` and `-l`)
- and, finally, a `C` compiler.

## Example

Consider the following (fictious) `github.com/me/hello` package:

```go
// hello is a simple package
package hello

import "fmt"

// Hello greets someone.
func Hello(name string) string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("hello %q from Go", name)
}
```

To create a `CPython` extension module out of it, you would run:

```sh
sh> cd somewhere        ## anywhere, under $PYTHONPATH
sh> gopy bind github.com/me/hello
2015/12/07 17:21:36 work: /tmp/gopy-012085634

sh> ll
total 3.2M
-rw-r--r-- 1 binet binet 3.2M Dec  7 17:23 hello.so
```

The `hello` `CPython` extension module can then be imported from your favorite
`CPython-2` interpreter like any other module:

```sh
sh> python2
Python 2.7.10 (default, Sep  7 2015, 13:51:49) 
[GCC 5.2.0] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
```

```python
>>> import hello
>>> dir(hello)
['Hello', '__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', '__package__']

>>> print hello.Hello("advent-2015")
hello "advent-2015" from Go

>>> print hello.__doc__
hello is a simple package

>>> print hello.Hello.__doc__
Hello(str name) str

Hello greets someone.
```

`gopy` extracted all the `Go` documentation strings and attached them to their
`python` counterpart.
`gopy` also created a function `Hello`, translated the `Go` arguments into their
native `python` counterpart.

If you were curious enough to look under the hood of what `gopy` generated, you
would find:

- a `Go` file,
- a `C` header file, and
- a `C` source file.

```sh
sh> ll /tmp/gopy-012085634
total 12K
-rw-r--r-- 1 binet binet 4.0K Dec  7 17:23 hello.c
-rw-r--r-- 1 binet binet 2.5K Dec  7 17:23 hello.go
-rw-r--r-- 1 binet binet 1.7K Dec  7 17:23 hello.h
```

In the `Go` file:

```go
// Package main is an autogenerated binder stub for package hello.
// gopy gen -lang=go hello
//
// File is generated by gopy gen. Do not edit.
package main

//#cgo pkg-config: python-2.7 --cflags --libs
//#include <stdlib.h>
//#include <string.h>
//#include <complex.h>
import "C"

import (
        "fmt"
        "sync"
        "unsafe"

        "github.com/me/hello"
)

// ...

//export cgo_func_hello_Hello
// cgo_func_hello_Hello wraps hello.Hello
func cgo_func_hello_Hello(name string) (gopy_ret string) {
        _gopy_000 := hello.Hello(name)
        return _gopy_000
}

// buildmode=c-shared needs a 'main'
func main() {}
```

`gopy` generates a `cgo` function which wraps the original `Go` function
`hello.Hello` and also `cgo-export` (as `cgo_func_hello_Hello`) so it is
callable from `C`.
The `C` side looks like this:

```c
/* ... */

#include "Python.h"

// header exported from 'go tool cgo'
#include "hello.h"

#if PY_VERSION_HEX > 0x03000000
#error "Python-3 is not yet supported by gopy"
#endif

/* ... */

/* pythonization of: hello.Hello */
static PyObject*
cpy_func_hello_Hello(PyObject *self, PyObject *args) {
        GoString c_name;
        GoString c_gopy_ret;
        
        if (!PyArg_ParseTuple(args, "O&", cgopy_cnv_py2c_string, &c_name)) {
                return NULL;
        }
        
        
        c_gopy_ret = cgo_func_hello_Hello(c_name);
        
        return Py_BuildValue("O&", cgopy_cnv_c2py_string, &c_gopy_ret);
}

/* functions for package hello */
static PyMethodDef cpy_hello_methods[] = {
        {"Hello", cpy_func_hello_Hello, METH_VARARGS, "Hello(str name) str\n\nHello greets someone.\n"},
        {NULL, NULL, 0, NULL}        /* Sentinel */
};

PyMODINIT_FUNC
inithello(void)
{
        PyObject *module = NULL;
        
        /* make sure Cgo is loaded and initialized */
        cgo_pkg_hello_init();
        
        module = Py_InitModule3("hello", cpy_hello_methods, "hello is a simple package\n");
        
}
```

The generated `C` code uses the `CPython` API to create a `CPython` module, fill
the _ad_ _hoc_ structures and connect the `cgo` functions with the `CPython`
infrastructure, together with the `python` docstrings.

## Implementation notes

`gopy`, like [gomobile](https://golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile), has the
interesting task of binding two languages together, each of them with a garbage
collector.
Thus, `gopy` needs to arrange somehow for the bindings to setup a kind of
protocol so that each garbage collector knows when a foreign value is not needed
anymore.
To that end, `gopy` notes when a `Go` value crosses the `python` boundary and
increments a counter so the `Go` garbage collector will not try to collect it
while the `python` side has a hold on it.
On the `python` side, the `C` extension module is generated in such a way that
the `python` garbage collector will tell the `Go` side when that value is not
needed anymore, as far as the `python` side is concerned.
 
As a consequence, any `Go` value that somehow crosses the language boundary
needs to be allocated on the heap: `gopy` takes care of that while generating
the `cgo` package.

Schematically, a call from `python` to a `Go` function looks like:

```
// Call sequence (lots of hand-waving)

-> python:    hello.Hello("foo")
 -> cpython:  cpy_func_hello_Hello(...)
  -> cgo:     cgo_func_hello_Hello(...)
   -> go:     hello.Hello(...)
```

so, while `gopy` will help bring some of the `Go` goodies to `python`, the
wrapped entities should not be called inside a very tight loop.

Another interesting point to note is that, as `gopy` uses `cgo`, it is subject
to the new and more stringent rules that are devised for [Go-1.6](https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/12416-cgo-pointers.md).
As a consequence, some internal parts of `gopy` will need to be modified to
generate code that follows these news.
Unfortunately, this probably means another slight performance hit with regard to
what could be achieved with `Go-1.5`.

`gopy` is currently able to wrap `struct` types, named types, slice types and array
types, as well as the methods which are attached to it.
`gopy` is also clever enough to translate functions using the [comma-error idiom](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) into their `python` equivalent (_ie:_ a function raising an `Exception`.)
Exported `var`s and `const`s are also handled: `gopy` generates "getters" and
"setters" for the former and only "getters" for the latter, to preserve the
semantics of the original Go package.
For slices and arrays, `gopy` generates code that implements the sequence and
buffer protocols.
Hence, `gopy` strives to generate types that look like idiomatic python classes.

## Limitations

`gopy` is still a very young project and many features are still missing.
It currently does not support:

- exposing `map[T]U` types
- exposing `chan T` types
- exposing `interfaces` (except `error`)
- implementing a `Go` interface from `python`
- exposing functions or methods taking pointers to values
- wrapping a package which exposes as part of its API types from another package.

Also, currently, `gopy` generates code only for the `CPython-2` API, even if
there are no known showstoppers to support `CPython-3` or other `python` VMs.

## gopy.py

`gopy` ships with a little `python` module -- `gopy.py` -- to test and bind 
interactively any `Go` package:

```python
>>> import gopy
>>> gopy.load("github.com/me/hello")
gopy> inferring package name...
gopy> loading 'github.com/me/hello'...
2015/12/08 12:29:20 work: /tmp/gopy-706904864
gopy> importing 'github.com/me/hello'
<module 'github.com/me/hello' from '/tmp/gopheracademy/hello.so'>

>>> hello = _
>>> print hello
<module 'github.com/me/hello' from '/tmp/gopheracademy/hello.so'>

>>> print hello.__doc__
hello is a simple package
```

`gopy.py` calls the `gopy bind` command to generate and compile the `Go` package
and then imports the generated `C` extension module into the current
interpreter.
This effectively makes every single `Go` package available from the `python`
interpreter (as long as it is supported by `gopy`, of course.)

## Conclusions

Thanks to the simple rules of the `Go` language and the packages available with 
the standard library, it is possible and reasonnably easy to automatically and
programmatically:

- inspect a `Go` package,
- extract the exported API and
- generate bindings for a foreign language, `python`.

It is not unreasonnable to imagine `Go` to become the perfect low-level
companion language for `python`, thanks to its quick development cycle and its
runtime performance, especially in the concurrent programming space.
`gopy` is a young project, recently made possible thanks to `Go-1.5` and there
is still a lot of work to support the whole `Go` language. 
`gopy` is released under the BSD-3 license and welcomes bug reports,
contributions or new ideas: join us [here](https://github.com/go-python/gopy).

`gopy` may be just a first step towards a tool suite akin to
what [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) is for `C/C++` but for `Go`.
This would help the percolation of `Go` through "foreign" code bases and
strengthen `Go`'s case as a `C` replacement.
I encourage people interested in this idea to join us at the
[go-binder](https://github.com/go-binder) organization.
